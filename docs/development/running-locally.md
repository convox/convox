# Running Locally

Running your application locally requires a [Development Rack](../instalation/development-rack) to be installed.

## Starting Your Application

Once you have a Development Rack, you can go to the directory containing your application code and run `convox start`.

    $ convox start

### Code Sync

Convox automatically synchronizes your local changes up to the Development Rack so that you can work
using your favorite editor.

All files or directories that appear in a `COPY` or `ADD` directive in your `Dockerfile` will be
synchronized.

> Files or directories that appear in `.dockerignore` will not be synchronized.

## Development Target

You can use a build target named `development` in your `Dockerfile` to work locally on an application that will be
later compiled to a binary and have its source code removed before deploying to production.

    FROM golang:1.13 AS development
    ENV DEVELOPMENT=true
    COPY . .
    RUN go install ./cmd/web
    CMD ["bin/development", "web"]

    FROM ubuntu:18.04 as production
    ENV DEVELOPMENT=false
    COPY --from=development /go/bin/web /app/web
    CMD ["/app/web"]

In this example during `convox start` only the first section of the Dockerfile will be run. This allows you to
work in a container that contains the full source code where you can set `CMD` to a script that automatically
recompiles and reloads the application when the source code is changed.

When deploying to production the entire Dockerfile would be run and you would end up with a bare `ubuntu:18.04` container
with only the compiled binary copied into it.
