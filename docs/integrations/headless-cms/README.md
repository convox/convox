# Headless CMS Integrations

Convox offers seamless integration with popular headless Content Management Systems (CMS), allowing you to connect your content publishing workflows with your deployment processes. This enables content creators to trigger deployments directly from their CMS interface, streamlining the content publishing workflow.

Headless CMS platforms separate the content management from the presentation layer, giving you the flexibility to use the content across multiple platforms and channels while maintaining control over the technical implementation.

## Available Integrations

The Convox Contentful integration allows you to trigger Convox workflow deployments directly from the Contentful interface, creating a seamless publishing workflow from content creation to deployment.
