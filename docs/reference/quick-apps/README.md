# Quick Apps

## Overview

Quick Apps makes it effortless to deploy popular applications and frameworks directly into your Convox rack. With just a few clicks, you can set up, install, and manage fully integrated Convox apps—leveraging all the scalability, automation, and operational benefits of the Convox platform.

Unlike manual deployments, Quick Apps handles **infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and application setup** for you, reducing deployment time and complexity. Whether you're launching a **content management system (CMS), e-commerce platform, or automation tool**, Quick Apps streamlines the process so you can focus on building, not configuring.

### **Key Features**
- **Rapid Deployment** – Set up a fully functional application in minutes.
- **Scalability & Automation** – Deployed apps inherit Convox's autoscaling, monitoring, and operational benefits.
- **Flexible Installation Options** – Choose between standard (pre-configured) installations or **Git-based** deployments for custom projects.
