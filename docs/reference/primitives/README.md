# Primitives

Primitives are the building blocks available to build an [App](app) on Convox. Apps are deployed and run on your [Rack](rack), the platform overlaid on your cloud infrastructure.

Primitives can be easily composed to provide useful functionality that lets you
focus on the things that make your [App](app) unique.
