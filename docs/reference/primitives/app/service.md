# Service

A Service is a horizontally-scalable collection of durable [Processes](/reference/primitives/app/process).

[Processes](/reference/primitives/app/process) that belong to a Service are automatically restarted upon termination.

Services can be scaled to a static count or autoscaled in a range based on metrics.

> Environment variables declared on `convox.yml` will be populated for a Service.

#### *annotations
You can use annotations to attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to objects. Clients such as tools and libraries can retrieve this metadata. On Convox, annotations will reflect in pods and service accounts.

Here are some examples of information that can be recorded in annotations:
- Build, release, or image information like timestamps, release IDs, git branch, PR numbers, image hashes, and registry address.
- Fields managed by a declarative configuration layer. Attaching these fields as annotations distinguishes them from default values set by clients or servers, and from auto-generated fields and fields set by auto-sizing or auto-scaling systems.
- User or tool/system provenance information, such as URLs of related objects from other ecosystem components.
- Configure a service to assume an IAM Role(AWS and GCP only). For example:
```
environment:
  - PORT=3000
services:
  web:
    annotations:
      - eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn=arn:aws:iam::accountID:role/yourOwnIAMRole
    domain: ${HOST}
    build: .
    port: 3000
```
