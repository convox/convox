# Resource

A Resource is a network-accessible external service.

## Definition

A Resource is defined in [`convox.yml`](../convox.yml.md) and linked to one or more [Services](service.md).

    resources:
      main:
        type: postgres
    services:
      web:
        resources:
          - main

### Types

The following Resource types are currently available:

* [`memcached`](resource/memcached.md)
* [`mysql`](resource/mysql.md)
* [`postgres`](resource/postgres.md)
* [`redis`](resource/redis.md)

## Linking

Linking a Resource to a [Service](service.md) causes an environment variable to be injected into [Processes](process.md)
of that [Service](service.md) based on the name of the Resource.

The URL presented by this environment variable will contain everything you need to connect, including authentication details.

For example, a `postgres` resource named `main` (as in the example above) would injected like this:

`MAIN_URL=postgres://username:password@host.name:port/database`

## Command Line Interface

### Listing Resources

    $ convox resources -a myapp
    NAME  TYPE      URL
    main  postgres  postgres://username:password@host.name:port/database

### Getting Information about a Resource

    $ convox resources info main -a myapp
    Name  main
    Type  postgres
    URL   postgres://username:password@host.name:port/database

### Getting the URL for a Resource

    $ convox resources url main -a myapp

### Starting a Proxy to a Resource

    $ convox resources proxy main -a myapp
    Proxying localhost:5432 to host.name:port
