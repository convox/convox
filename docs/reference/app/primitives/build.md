# Build

A Build is a compiled version of the code for each [Service](service.md) of an [App](../../app.md).

Convox uses `docker` to compile code into a Build.

## Definition

You can define the location to build for each [Service](service.md) in [`convox.yml`](../convox.yml.md).

    services:
      api:
        build: ./api
      web:
        build: ./web
        manifest: Dockerfile.production

## Command Line Interface

### Creating a Build

    $ convox build -a myapp
    Packaging source... OK
    Uploading source... OK
    Starting build... OK
    ...
    Build: BABCDEFGHI
    Release: RBCDEFGHIJ

> Every time a Build is created a new [Release](release.md) is created that references the Build.

### Listing Builds
