# Django

Our example Django app can be found [here](https://github.com/convox-examples/django).

The following is a step-by-step walkthrough of how the app was configured and why. The sample app is copied from the [Django 2.1 tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/), Dockerised, configured and a `convox.yml` added.  See the `README.md` in the repo for the changes made.

### Running Locally

Before we begin you will need to install the `convox` CLI and a development Rack:

* [Command Line Interface](../installation/cli.md)
* [Development Rack](../installation/development-rack)

Once you are all setup you can switch to your local rack with ```convox switch [rack name]``` and start your local application with ```convox start``` (make sure you are in the root directory).

Now that your app is up and running you will need to run the migrations with a [one-off command](/management/run):

```bash
convox run web python manage.py migrate
```

And create a super user for the Django Admin

```bash
convox run web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You should now be able to access your application by going to [https://web.django.convox](https://web.django.convox). If you renamed anything you may need to modify your local URL. The format is https://[service name].[app name].convox

### Custom Application Components

#### Dockerfile

Starting from the [python:3](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/) image, the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/convox-examples/django/blob/master/Dockerfile) executes the remaining build steps that your Django app needs. There are basically 2 steps in this process, and they are executed in a particular order to take advantage of Docker's build caching behavior.

1. Requirements.txt is copied and `pip install` is run. This happens first because it is slow and something that's done infrequently. After running once, this step will be cached unless the cache is busted by later edits to `requirements.txt`.

2. The application source is copied over. These files will change frequently, so this step of the build will very rarely be cached.

#### convox.yml

The [convox.yml](https://github.com/convox-examples/django/blob/master/convox.yml) file explains how to run the application. This file has two sections.

1. Resources: These are network-attached dependencies of your application. In this case we have a single resource which is a postgres database. When deployed Convox will automatically startup up a container running Postgres and will inject a ```DATABASE_URL``` environment variable into your application container that points to the Postgres database.

2. Services: This is where we define our application(s). In this case we have a single application called ```web``` which is built from our dockerfile, executes the [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) web server, and uses the postgres resource for a database. You will also notice we have an [environment](https://docs.convox.com/management/environment) section where we are setting a default secret key for development. In a production application you may have additional services defined for things like Celery task workers.

### Deploying to production

Install a production Rack on the cloud provider of your choice:

* [Production Rack](../installation/production-rack)

Once you are all set here you can see the name of your production rack

```bash
convox racks
```

And switch your CLI to your production rack

```bash
convox switch [rack name]
```

Now you can create an empty application in your production rack

```bash
convox apps create --wait
```

And you can deploy your application to production (the first time you do this it may take up to 15 minutes to create the necessary resources)

```bash
convox deploy --wait
```

Then you can run your migrations and create your super user same as you did against your local rack

```bash
convox run web python manage.py migrate
```

```bash
convox run web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Finally you can retrieve the URL from your production application with

```bash
convox services
```
