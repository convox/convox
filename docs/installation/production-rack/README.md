# Production Rack

A production Rack runs on a cloud provider.

> We recommend installing Production Racks using the [Convox Web Console](https://console.convox.com). However you can install a Production Rack via the command line using the instuctions for each specific cloud provider linked here. Please note that if you install via the command line and you later want to manage that Rack from the web console you will need to [move your rack](..management/console-rack-management) into the web console first.
