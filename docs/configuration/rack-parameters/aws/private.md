# private

## Description
The `private` parameter specifies whether to place nodes in private subnets behind NAT gateways. This is a security best practice as it limits direct exposure to the internet, protecting the nodes from external threats.

**Note**: The `private` parameter is immutable and cannot be changed once a rack has been created. Ensure you set this parameter correctly during the initial rack setup based on your security and network requirements.

## Default Value
The default value for `private` is `true`.

## Use Cases
- **Enhanced Security**: By placing nodes in private subnets, you reduce the attack surface area as the nodes are not directly accessible from the internet.
- **Compliance Requirements**: Certain compliance standards may require that sensitive workloads run in private subnets.

## Setting Parameters
The `private` parameter must be configured at rack installation. Example:
| Key                    | Value                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `private`  | `true` |

&nbsp;

## Additional Information
When the `private` parameter is set to `true`, nodes are placed in private subnets, which enhances security by preventing direct access from the internet.

Proper configuration of private subnets is essential to ensure network connectivity and security for your applications. By setting the `private` parameter, you can improve the security posture of your Convox rack.
