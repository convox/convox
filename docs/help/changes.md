# Changes

This document outlines the changes from Version 2 (date-based version) Racks to Version 3.x Racks.

## Apps

### Agent Ports

Agent ports are now defined at the service level instead of underneath the `agent:` block:

#### Version 2

    services:
      datadog:
        agent:
          ports:
            - 8125/udp
            - 8126/tcp

#### Version 3

    services:
      datadog:
        agent: true
        ports:
          - 8125/udp
          - 8126/tcp

### Sticky Sessions

App services are no longer sticky by default. Sticky sessions can be enabled in `convox.yml`:

    services
      web:
        sticky: true
