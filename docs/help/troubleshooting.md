# Troubleshooting

## Development Rack

### Installation

Ensure you have followed the setup instructions for your local OS [here](../installation/development-rack).  Memory requirements for running Docker/Kubernetes locally can often catch people out.

## Production Rack

### Installation

One of the majoy advantages of Convox is that it abstracts you from the complexities involved in installing Kubernetes clusters on the cloud provider of your choice.  You are still subject, unfortunately, to any errors or issues that your provider is experiencing.  If encountering an error during installation, it's worth checking the Status page for your provider:

- [AWS](https://status.aws.amazon.com/)
- [GCP](https://status.cloud.google.com/)
- [Azure](https://status.azure.com/en-us/status)
- [Digital Ocean](https://status.digitalocean.com/)

And to retry your installation after a few minutes.  You can retry the installation by simply running `convox rack update -r <rackname>`.
If your Rack consistently fails to install into your Cloud provider and there are no relevant issues reported then please raise a [support ticket](/help/support) for us to investigate.

### Scaling

Scaling issues can often arise when you run into quota limits set by your cloud provider.  Ensure you have adequate limits in place for your scaling needs by contacting your cloud provider's support to get them set appropriately.

## Running your Apps

### Health Checks

Any Services within your App that expose a port will require a passing [health check](../configuration/health-checks) before receiving traffic.  Deploying a Release of your App that does not pass the health checks will result in a rollback to the previous release.  If this is your first release of a new App, a failing health check will result in a failed deployment.
Failing health checks will be reported when promoting your Release:

You should ensure that your App is able to respond to the health check probes to faciliate a successful deployment.
