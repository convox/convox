### Installation

One of the majoy advantages of Convox is that it abstracts you from the complexities involved in installing Kubernetes clusters on the cloud provider of your choice.  You are still subject, unfortunately, to any errors or issues that your provider is experiencing.  If encountering an error during installation, it's worth checking the Status page for your provider.
